This python script is used to configure the DW1000 chip as a device to emulate a ping/pong message transmission. 
It must be used in conjunction with another PingPong script setup as the opposite trxToggle, meaning that there should be two scripts : Receiver + Transmitter
It requires the following modules: DW1000, DW1000Constants
